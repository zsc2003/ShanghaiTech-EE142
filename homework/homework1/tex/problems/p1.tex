\textcolor{blue}{Problem 1}

\textbf{2.1} Coin flips. A fair coin is flipped until the first head occurs. Let $X$ denote the number of flips required.

(a) Find the entropy $H(X)$ in bits. The following expressions may be useful:
$$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} r^n=\frac{1}{1-r}, \quad \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} n r^n=\frac{r}{(1-r)^2}$$

(b) A random variable $X$ is drawn according to this distribution. Find an "efficient" sequence of yes-no questions of the form, "Is $X$ contained in the set $S$ ?" Compare $H(X)$ to the expected number of questions required to determine $X$. \\
