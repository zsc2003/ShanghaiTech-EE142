\textcolor{blue}{Problem 3}

2.5 Zero conditional entropy. Show that if $H(Y \mid X)=0$, then $Y$ is a function of $X$ [i.e., for all $x$ with $p(x)>0$, there is only one possible value of $y$ with $p(x, y)>0]$.

\textcolor{blue}{Solution}

Suppose that there exist a $x_1$ with $p(x_1)>0$, there are more than $1$ possible values of $y$ with $p(x_1, y)>0$. \\
Suppose that they are
$$p(x_1,y_1),\cdots,p(x_1,y_k), k\geq 2$$

Since there are more than $1$ possible values of $y$ with $p(x, y)>0$, we have
$$p(y_i|x_1)=\dfrac{p(x_1,y_i)}{p(x_1)}\in (0,1), i=1,\cdots,k$$
i.e. $\log\dfrac{1}{p(x_1,y_i)}>0$.\\
So
\begin{align*}
H(Y|X) &= \sum_{x,y}p(x,y)\log\dfrac{1}{p(y|x)} \\
&\geq \sum_{i=1}^k p(x_1,y_i)\log\dfrac{1}{p(y_i|x_1)} \\
&> 0
\end{align*}
Which is a contradiction with $H(Y|X)=0$.\\
So for all $x$ with $p(x)>0$, there is only one possible value of $y$ with $p(x, y)>0$.
